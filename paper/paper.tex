% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1

% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

\title{EasyMerge - A New Tool for Code Clones Refactoring}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Introduction}
In software development, it's very common seeing developers reuse code fragments by copying and pasting with or without minor adaptation.
Moreover, for large scale projects, developers are often too lazy to browse existing source files so that they may rewrite similar or even identical functions which
were already in the code base. As a result, software systems often contain sections of code that are very similar, called code clones.

Previous research shows that a significant fraction (between 7\% and 23\%) of the code in a typical software system has been cloned \cite{baker} \cite{roy}. Many code clones
in code bases are unnecessary duplications. 
Code duplication can be a significant drawback, leading to bad design, and increased probability of bug occurrence and propagation. As a result, it can significantly
increase maintenance cost, and form a barrier for software evolution. By detecting, categorizing,
and removing code clones, we can produce easier to understand, cleaner, and more reusable code.

Clone detection has been an avid research topic in the field of software engineering for decades. Fortunately, several automated techniques for detecting code clones
have already been proposed. However, how to deal with detected clones, e.g. how to distinguish necessary clones from unnecessary ones and how to refactor code to remove
unnecessary clones still remain a big problem in not only commercial but also academic domain. As a result, in this paper, we try to classify code clones and build
a recommendation system called EasyMerge to help developers merge unnecessary clones on top of current state-of-the-art clone detection approach.

More specifically, we pick CloneDigger \cite{bulychev}, an anti-unification duplicate code detection tool as our underlying clone detection approach. CloneDigger is one of the best available 
clone detection tools currently for its overall performance, coverage of multiple clone types, and availability. 
EasyMerge integrates CloneDigger as the pre-processing tool, analyze its output clone pairs, and recommend possible merges which can remove unnecessary clones without changing functionality of code base, creating reference conflicts, nor causing troubles to future code understanding and development.

The paper is structured as following: we first go through the basics, background, and current state of clone detection and code clone refactoring in general.
Then we introduce and discuss the fundamentals of CloneDigger and the anti-unification algorithm it is using to detect clones. Afterwards, we explain EasyMerge's
work flow and underlying techniques. And at the end, we set up testing environment and discuss the experimental results of running EasyMerge against several
open source projects of different scales.
